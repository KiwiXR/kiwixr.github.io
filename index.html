  <ul>
    <li><p>
      I am a first-year master's student at the Transfer Learning Group (<a href="https://github.com/BIT-DA">BIT-DA</a>) at Beijing Institute of Technology, advised by <a href="https://shuangli.xyz" class="uline">Prof. Shuang Li</a> and Prof. Chi Harold Liu.
      </p></li>
    <li><p>
      I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from BIT (2018-2022).
      </p></li>
    <li><p>
      My research interests are in transfer learning and data-efficient scene understanding. My current research directions include domain adaptation for dense prediction tasks like semantic segmentation.
